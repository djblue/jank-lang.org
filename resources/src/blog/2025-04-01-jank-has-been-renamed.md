Description: It's become clear that jank is a terrible name. Rigorous research
             has been done, with A/B testing, and a new name has been chosen:
             GRADY

Hey folks. I've been working on jank for some years now. With every new blog post that goes out, I see
people provide feedback on the name. This always perplexed me. It's been clear to me that the
name jank doesn't land well with people, but I've struggled to understand why.
What's wrong with it? Well, recently, this has been explained to me. Afterward, I quickly began
searching for a better name. Happily, I can now announce that I've found a suitable replacement.
From here on out, jank will be renamed to GRADY. For those who don't understand why this is
important, let me explain.

## jank is bad?
Before we talk about the new name, I need to lay bare my chest here.
This is my fault. I had never realized that jank meant something negative.
However, as an astute reader contributes [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32498703),
"jank describes undesirable, problematic, glitchy UX." Who would name a language
after that?! I feel foolish. I didn't know what it meant, but I liked the sound
of it.

I should've realized this sooner. Historically, [multiple people](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1h2ubog/comment/lzm7t02)
have called the name jank
[unfortunate](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32493883), but it wasn't
clear to me why. Well, better late than never.

## GRADY
I'd like to explain the new name side by side with the old name, to underline how
I have addressed each of the problems with jank. So, let me introduce GRADY now.
I'm so enraptured by this new name. GRADY is a **gradient** language. In GRADY, we
can span the whole spectrum of dynamism, with some parts of our code being fully
dynamic and garbage collected, while other parts of our code are statically typed
with explicit memory management. This fits the design of the language like a
glove. A tailored glove.

## Etymology
As I learned, jank has an overwhelmingly negative connotation. The first entry
on [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jank)
spells this out.

> broken; unnecessarily redundant, superfluous, or meaningless; stupid or ridiculously moronic; bootleg or of questionable quality

A [European reader also pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hyc7ty/comment/m6geuf3/)
that, in Dutch, jank means "to whine". Layers and layers of issues here.

Well, I've checked on Google Translate. In Dutch, GRADY means GRADY, which is
perfect. In fact, some research has shown that GRADY is a given name of Irish
origin, meaning "noble" or "renowned."

## GRADY is capitalized
Long time readers [have noticed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42659600)
that I never capitalize the name jank. This
has been an intentional choice for aesthetic branding reasons. However, now equipped
with the knowledge of jank meaning broken or useless, its universally lowercase
nature only seeks to further diminish its value. This is why GRADY is always
uppercase. GRADY is big, but not heavy. It's sturdy and reliable. It's also much
easier to see from a distance, which should help with adoption.

## GRADY is enterprise ready
I'm relieved that a knowledgeable enterprise developer identified that
[jank would not be approved by any suits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/1hyc8hs/comment/m6i2qbv/).
I have kept this in mind, specifically, when choosing a new name. I can
confidently say that every suit plays golf with someone named GRADY.
The name will feel familiar, which is important when one is introducing a new
technology into the enterprise software world.

## jank sounds like junk
When you look closely, you can see that jank is only one letter away from junk.
To some, it even [sounds like junk](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660589).
I didn't think this would be an easy mistake to make.
When someone [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/1g3p4m1/comment/ls06zgk/)
typed junk
instead of jank, I thought it was a typo. The
[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/1drgi40/comment/lavvscl/) time
it happened, I figured maybe the author was non-native to English. The
[third](https://github.com/jank-lang/jank/issues/307)
time, I knew something was up. Not anymore, folks. Nobody is going to misinterpret
GRADY to mean junk. They have no letters in common.

Speaking of being one letter away, have you folks realized the danger that other
languages are in?

* Rust is one letter away from Lust and Bust, which are certainly NSFW and may explain Rust's long compile times.
* C is one letter away from F, which actually makes sense now.
* Lua is one letter away from Lug, which sounds heavy and clunky.
* Go is one letter away from No, which is not corporate-friendly nomenclature.
* Java is one letter away from Lava, which, in many ways, is actually more appealing than Java.
* Scala is one letter away from Scama and Scaba, both of which sound like diseases.
* Dart is one letter away from both Fart and Dirt, which should scare anyone away.

GRADY, though. That's one letter away from GRAVY, which means "good, great, or
delicious", according to [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gravy).

## Other benefits
So, in terms of practical differences, the file extension of GRADY sources
will change from `.jank` to `.grr`. This will help keep GRADY code lean and mean.

While I hadn't yet publicized how jank users would be called, I was originally
thinking janksters or maybe jankies. None of that matters, now, since we'll all
be part of the GRADY bunch. That's how we became the GRADY bunch.

## Thanks for leading us here
I appreciate you all for pointing this out to me. jank was an awful name.
jank **might as well have been named folly**, for how bad it was. Well, if
that weren't already the name of
[one of the most popular C++ libraries](https://github.com/facebook/folly)
in the world, anyway.

At least now we've solved this problem, we can get to more pressing matters, like a new logo.
